## Each developer is given only one module to build frontend for.

## You will find your module in the backend directory in the codebase, first read the following instructions !.

## üìã Developer Responsibilities

### Before You Start
1. **Study Your Module Comprehensively**: 
   - **Deep Dive Analysis**: Spend significant time studying your assigned backend module in extreme detail
   - **Complete Coverage**: Ensure you understand EVERY model, view, endpoint, serializer, task, signal, and utility function
   - **Business Logic Mastery**: Understand the complete business logic flow, edge cases, and error handling
   - **API Mapping**: Map out every single API endpoint and understand its purpose, parameters, and responses
   - **Data Relationships**: Understand how your module's models relate to other modules
   - **100% Utilization Goal**: Your frontend implementation must utilize 100% of your backend module's functionality - no endpoint, feature, or capability should be left unused
2. **Review the Design System**: Familiarize yourself with the established theme and components
3. **Understand the API**: Study the backend endpoints and data structures
4. **Plan Your Implementation**: Create a development plan for your module
5. **Document Integration Needs**: If you need integration with other modules' frontend components, document this in `src/[your-module]/notes.md`

### Development Standards

#### 0. Critical Rules
- **DO NOT EDIT OTHER MODULES**: You may only edit files within your assigned module directory (`src/[your-module]/`)
- **DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES**: Never edit files in `src/components/core/`, `src/theme/`, `src/api/`, `src/store/`, `src/utils/`, or any other shared directories
- **INTEGRATION DOCUMENTATION**: If you need integration with other modules' frontend components, document your requirements in `src/[your-module]/notes.md` - do not implement cross-module integrations yourself
- **100% BACKEND COVERAGE**: Every single backend endpoint, model field, and feature in your module must have corresponding frontend implementation

#### 1. File Organization
```
src/[your-module]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/                 # Top-level page components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/            # Module-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                 # Custom hooks for your module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                   # API service functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                 # Module-specific utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                # Module-specific assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes.tsx             # Module routing configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts               # Module exports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.md               # Integration requirements and notes
```

#### 2. Backend Module Study Requirements
- **Model Analysis**: Understand every field, relationship, and method in your module's models
- **View Analysis**: Map every view function to a frontend page or component
- **Serializer Analysis**: Understand all data transformations and validation rules
- **Task Analysis**: Identify which async operations need frontend status tracking
- **Signal Analysis**: Understand what triggers automatic updates that might affect your UI
- **URL Analysis**: Map every endpoint to frontend functionality
- **Admin Analysis**: Study the admin interface to understand the full scope of management features needed
- **Test Analysis**: Review test files to understand edge cases and expected behaviors

#### 3. Complete Feature Coverage Checklist
For your assigned module, ensure you implement:
- [ ] **All CRUD Operations**: Every model that has Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- [ ] **All List Views**: With proper filtering, sorting, and pagination
- [ ] **All Detail Views**: Complete information display and editing capabilities
- [ ] **All Custom Endpoints**: Special endpoints beyond basic CRUD
- [ ] **All Form Fields**: Every field from your models and serializers
- [ ] **All Validation Rules**: Frontend validation matching backend validation
- [ ] **All Status Indicators**: Visual representation of all status fields
- [ ] **All Relationships**: Proper handling of foreign keys and many-to-many relationships
- [ ] **All Async Operations**: Status tracking for background tasks
- [ ] **All Error States**: Proper error handling for every possible error condition
- [ ] **All Success States**: Confirmation and feedback for every successful operation
- [ ] **All Edge Cases**: Handle empty states, loading states, and error conditions

#### 2. Component Guidelines
- **Use Core Components**: Always use components from `@/components/core` when possible
- **Follow MUI Theme**: Use theme values for colors, spacing, typography
- **Add Animations**: Use Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Handle Loading States**: Show loading spinners during async operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure components work on all screen sizes

#### 3. API Integration
- **Use TanStack Query**: All API calls should use React Query hooks
- **Follow Query Key Patterns**: Use the established query key factory
- **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- **Cache Appropriately**: Set proper cache times and invalidation

#### 4. State Management
- **Local State First**: Use local state (`useState`, `useReducer`) when possible
- **Global State**: Only use global state for truly shared data
- **Form State**: Use React Hook Form for all forms

#### 5. TypeScript
- **Strict Types**: No `any` types allowed
- **Define Interfaces**: Create proper interfaces for your data
- **Export Types**: Make types available for other modules if needed

### üìù Module-Specific Implementation Requirements

#### Backend Module Mapping
Each developer must create a comprehensive mapping document in their `notes.md` file that includes:

1. **Endpoint Mapping**: List every backend endpoint and its corresponding frontend implementation
2. **Model Field Mapping**: Map every model field to frontend form fields or display components
3. **Business Logic Mapping**: Document how complex backend logic is represented in the UI
4. **Integration Requirements**: Document any needs for integration with other modules' frontend components
5. **Missing Features**: If any backend feature cannot be implemented due to dependencies, document it clearly

#### Example notes.md Structure:
```markdown
# [Module Name] Frontend Implementation Notes

## Backend Coverage Analysis
### Models Implemented
- [ ] Model1: All fields implemented
- [ ] Model2: Missing field X (reason: requires integration with Y module)

### Endpoints Implemented
- [ ] GET /api/endpoint1/ ‚Üí Component/Page
- [ ] POST /api/endpoint2/ ‚Üí Form/Action

### Integration Requirements
- Need access to User profile data from users module
- Requires notification triggering from notifications module

### Implementation Challenges
- Complex workflow builder needs custom drag-drop component
- Real-time updates require WebSocket integration
```

### üé® Design System Usage

#### Colors
```typescript
// Use theme colors
sx={{ color: 'primary.main' }}
sx={{ backgroundColor: 'background.paper' }}
sx={{ borderColor: 'divider' }}
```

#### Spacing
```typescript
// Use consistent spacing (8px grid)
sx={{ p: 3 }}        // 24px padding
sx={{ m: 2 }}        // 16px margin
sx={{ gap: 1.5 }}    // 12px gap
```

#### Typography
```typescript
<Typography variant="h3">Page Title</Typography>
<Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary">Description</Typography>
<Typography variant="overline">Label</Typography>
```

#### Animations
```typescript
// Page transitions
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
>

// Hover effects
<motion.div
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
>
```

    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await api.get('/events/event-types/');
      return response.data;
    },
  });
};
```

#### Mutation Hook Example
```typescript
export const useCreateEventType = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: CreateEventTypeData) => {
      const response = await api.post('/events/event-types/', data);
      return response.data;
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.events.eventTypes() });
      toast.success('Event type created successfully');
    },
  });
};
